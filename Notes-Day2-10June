Demo Steps:
================================================

1. Become root user:

# sudo su -

3. Create a Local repository using GIT

#  mkdir myproject

# cd myproject

# touch index1.html index2.html

# ls

# git init

A local repository will be created

# ls -al

.git folder will be available, which is your local repository.


4. Add the configuration parameters in git, which will later update author and email details in the git commit history

2 variables need to be set

user.name
user.email


# git config --global user.name sonal0409

# git config --global user.email admin@gmail.com

List the configurations:

git config --list

try it latter
==========================
git config --global --unset user.name

git config --global --unset user.email



5. Add the files to the stagging area and commit them to Local repo
=========================================

# git status

# git add <filename> <filename2>

or

git add --all

or

git add .

or

git add *.java *.php

# git status

# git commit -m "adding file index1.html"

Commit all the changes/files in the stagging area

If we want to Choose a file to be commited

git commit -m "adding file index1.html" <filename>

================================================

Modify exisitng files and add those changes to local repo
====================================================

Take a file which is in local repo

# git ls-files

# vim index1.html

add any data & save the file

# git status

status of file is modified

To add all the modification and commit them to local repo

# git commit -a -m "added modifications"

=================================================
1. Check the log for commit history

# git log

in this HEAD it is an object in git which represents the latest/recent commit id

# git log --oneline

Check commit history of every commit in a single line

# git show <commid id>
Shows what happened in that commit.

See commits of a particular file:

 git log --graph --all -- index1.html

==============================================================

Delete a file form LR and WD
===================================================================
# git rm index1.html

==> this command deletes file from WD and LR
As we have deleted somethign on LR/made chnage on LR , we need to track that. So commit the deletion

# git commit -m "deleted file"

# git ls-files
# ls
File will not be in localrepo and WD

========================================================

Revert command in GIT
=========================================================
> This command is applicable only to commit id
> using this command we cna revert the chnages of the commit to its previous state
> but when a revert command is executed, it is chnage something on the LR, so there needs to be a commit again
> When revert command is executed, immediatly a nano editor where user will eneter a message why we are reverting
> save the file. Revert will be complete and a new commit id will be generated

# git revert <deletioncommitid>

=========================================================

Create a feature branch in git  and switch to the branch

========================================

# git branch

Create a new branch

# git branch feature1

Switch to the new branch

# git checkout feature1

[OR]

Create a new branch and switch to the branch also

# git checkout -b feature2

3. Merge the commits/files of new branch to master

Before merging always switch to the destination branch

# git checkout master

# git merge feature1 master

< git merge sourcebranch destinationbranch>


Check which branches are merged to master

git branch -a --merged master

Check which branches are not merged to master

git branch -a --no-merged master


4. Delete a branch which is not merged with master branch

# git branch -D <branchname>

Delete a branch whose commits have been merged with the master branch

# git branch -d feature1


=================================================
